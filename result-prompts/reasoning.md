- **Skull Morphology and Facial Structure**:  
  - Cats exhibit a more rounded, compact skull with a short, broad facial region. The nasal bridge is relatively flat, and the forehead is prominent. The muzzle is short and tapered.  
  - Dogs display greater cranial diversity due to domestication and selective breeding. However, generally, dogs have a more elongated skull (dolichocephalic) or a shortened, broad skull (brachycephalic), depending on breed. The nasal bridge is more pronounced, and the muzzle length varies significantly across breeds.  
  → *In image analysis: A short, rounded face with a flat forehead and small muzzle suggests a cat; a longer snout or extreme facial flattening (e.g., Pug) suggests a dog.*

- **Ear Shape and Position**:  
  - Cats have small, pointed ears set high on the head. Ears are vertically oriented and often mobile, capable of independent movement.  
  - Dogs have ears that vary widely in shape (floppy, upright, pointed, folded) and placement. Ears are generally larger in proportion to head size and may hang or stand erect.  
  → *In image analysis: Small, upright, pointed ears with high placement suggest a cat; large, drooping, or folded ears suggest a dog.*

- **Eye Position and Size**:  
  - Cats have large, forward-facing eyes with a more vertical pupil shape. The eyes are set close together and slightly upward, giving a "forward" gaze.  
  - Dogs have eyes that are more lateral in placement, though still forward-facing in most breeds. Pupils are typically round, and eye size varies greatly by breed.  
  → *In image analysis: Large, vertically oriented pupils and forward-facing, close-set eyes suggest a cat; more lateral eye placement and round pupils suggest a dog.*

- **Nose and Nasal Structure**:  
  - Cats have a small, narrow, and slightly upturned nasal tip. The nasal septum is short and prominent.  
  - Dogs have a larger, more robust nose, often with a visible nasal bridge and flared nostrils. The nasal structure is more pronounced and varies by breed.  
  → *In image analysis: A small, delicate, upturned nose suggests a cat; a large, broad nose with visible bridge suggests a dog.*

- **Limb Proportions and Locomotion**:  
  - Cats have a more flexible spine and a crouched, springy gait. Limbs are relatively short and robust, with retractable claws. The feet are small and pad-like, with visible toe pads.  
  - Dogs have longer limbs relative to body size, with non-retractable claws. Their gait is more extended and striding, often with a longer stride.  
  → *In image analysis: Short limbs, small feet, and crouched posture suggest a cat; long limbs, large feet, and extended gait suggest a dog.*

- **Tail Morphology**:  
  - Cats have long, slender tails that are often held upright or curled. The tail is used for balance and communication.  
  - Dogs have tails that vary in length, thickness, and curl. Tails are typically more robust and may be carried high, low, or curled over the back.  
  → *In image analysis: Long, slender, and often erect tail suggests a cat; thick, short, or curled tail with variable carriage suggests a dog.*

- **Fur Texture and Density**:  
  - Cats have a dense, short to medium-length coat, often with a double-layered undercoat. Fur is generally smooth and sleek, especially in domestic breeds.  
  - Dogs have a wider range of fur types—short, long, wiry, curly, thick, or sparse—depending on breed. Fur texture is more variable and often coarser.  
  → *In image analysis: Uniform, smooth, and dense fur suggests a cat; variable, coarse, or long fur suggests a dog.*

- **Paw Structure and Claws**:  
  - Cats have fully retractable claws, visible as small, curved, sharp claws when extended. The paw pads are small and clearly defined.  
  - Dogs have non-retractable claws, permanently visible. Paw pads are larger and more robust, often with visible digital pads.  
  → *In image analysis: Visible, curved, retractable claws suggest a cat; permanently exposed claws and larger pads suggest a dog.*

- **Body Posture and Musculature**:  
  - Cats display a low, agile, and flexible body posture. The back is arched, and the body is compact with a high center of gravity.  
  - Dogs have a more upright, elongated body posture in many breeds. The back is generally straighter, and the body is built for endurance and pulling.  
  → *In image analysis: Crouched, arched back, and compact body suggest a cat; straight back, elongated body, and upright stance suggest a dog.*

- **Behavioral Cues in Image (Indirect, but observable)**:  
  - Cats often appear in a crouched, alert, or resting posture with ears forward. They may tuck legs under body.  
  - Dogs often appear in a standing, alert, or walking posture with ears forward and body extended.  
  → *In image analysis: Crouched, tucked posture with ears forward suggests a cat; extended, alert posture with ears forward suggests a dog.*

**Conclusion for Image-Based Identification**:  
Use the following hierarchical checklist in image analysis:
1. **Facial structure**: Short, flat face with small muzzle → cat; long or variable snout → dog.
2. **Ears**: Small, pointed, upright → cat; large, floppy, or folded → dog.
3. **Eyes**: Large, vertically pupils, close-set → cat; round pupils, more lateral → dog.
4. **Nose**: Small, upturned → cat; large, prominent → dog.
5. **Limbs and gait**: Short, crouched, small feet → cat; long, extended, large feet → dog.
6. **Tail**: Long, slender, upright → cat; thick, variable, curled → dog.
7. **Claws**: Visible, curved, retractable → cat; permanently exposed → dog.
8. **Fur**: Dense, smooth, short → cat; variable texture and length → dog.
9. **Body posture**: Crouched, arched back → cat; straight, upright → dog.

**Final Determination**:  
An animal with **short face, small ears, large vertical pupils, small nose, crouched posture, retractable claws, and long slender tail** is a cat.  
An animal with **long or variable snout, large or floppy ears, round pupils, large nose, extended limbs, non-retractable claws, and variable tail** is a dog.
